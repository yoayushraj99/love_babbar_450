# Difficulty - Hard

# Given two strings A and B, the task is to convert A to B if possible.
# The only operation allowed is to put any character from A and insert it at front.
# Find if itâ€™s possible to convert the string. If yes, then output minimum
# no. of operations required for transformation.
